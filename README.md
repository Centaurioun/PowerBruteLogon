# PowerBruteLogon

PowerBruteLogon is a ported version of [WinBruteLogon](https://github.com/DarkCoderSc/win-brute-logon) in pure PowerShell

‚ö†Ô∏è Notice: this version is slower than [WinBruteLogon](https://github.com/DarkCoderSc/win-brute-logon) but has the serious advantage of being 100% entirely coded in PowerShell. In a near future, password attempts will be distributed to separate threads to speed up the process. Also keep in mind that this method is very noisy, each failed attempt will get logged on Microsoft Windows Event Logs.
